    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a driven and dedicated college student at Brigham Young University. Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Finance. I aspire to become an Asset Manager and make a difference in the world.</p>
        <p>Besides my academic commitments, I work part-time as an account manager for the BYU cellular department and as Career Speciailist in the Business Career Center at the Marriott School of Business.</p>
        <p>My education and work experience led me to gain and develop communication and managerial skills that have been useful in my life. I am an open person willing to learn and become a better person.</p>
        <p>I enjoy spending time with my family and helping others. I regularly volunteer with local nonprofit organizations to build others and my community. Changing the world might be impossible, but I believe that when we help someone in need, we are changing someone’s world.</p>
